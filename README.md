This work provides a systematic overview of the concept of multi-level simulation and its applications. 
We begin by explaining the fundamentals of simulation, illustrating how simulations aim to capture real-world complexities.  
Going beyond the basics, we look at different definitions of a model. We discuss how to handle different abstraction levels and how to connect them.
The major portion involves introducing several methods for conducting multi-level simulations. 
We present different techniques, such as using agentbased simulations or machine learning concepts. Multi-level simulations find
applications in various fields, from social sciences to engineering, showing
their versatility and relevance. We discuss different approaches from different
areas and break down different patterns, explaining how they help resolve
complexities. Real-world examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of
these design patterns in overcoming obstacles in the simulation processes.
In conclusion, this work not only provides a comprehensive guide to understanding multi-level simulation methodologies and their wide-ranging applications across diverse fields 
but also addresses a notable gap in the literature by offering a much-needed overview in a field where such reviews are scarce.
